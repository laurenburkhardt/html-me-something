            <h2>How We Met<h2>
            <p>
              It was a sunny Sunday in mid September of 2013. My partner, Andrew, and I were visiting my parents. I mentioned we were considering adopting a dog. We had a cat (Andrew's cat),but I wanted a pet that would be affectionate, happy to see us, and capable of love. Mom suggested we try Open Door Animal Sanctuary in House Springs, Missouri. On a whim, we drove out there that afternoon. We considered one dog that was pretty high-energy, another that had a dry skin condition, and then we met a little scruffy brown and white dog with a short nose and a snaggle tooth. She crawled right into my lap, curled up, and the decision was made.

            <h2>The Adoption<h2>
            <p>
               Open Door said she was found wandering around a nursing home. She was calm and friendly, so the staff kept her for a few weeks before bringing her to the shelter. Based on this backstory, I gave her the cutest old lady name I could think of: Mabel. They guessed she was about three years old, and as far as her breed, they suggested some combinations of little dogs: Pekignese, Pug, Chihuahua, Shih-Tzhu, etc. We didn't care. She was perfect. We filled out the paperwork, scheduled a home inspection, and brought her home the following weekend.

            <h2>Mabel's Likes<h2>
            <p>
             As one might suspect, Mabel's absolute favorite hobby is eating any kind of human food, including broccoli stems. She also enjoys roadtrips. She's been to Tulsa, Chicago, and most recently, the Great Smoky Mountains. She loves her family, especially Andrew for some reason. But enough on that. While not a yappy dog, she does like to bark from time to time, mostly at noises she hears outside. She likes short walks with frequent opportunities to stop and smell the ground. Even at nearly 10 years of age, Mabel exercises daily. Her fitness routine includes chasing a toy and visciously thrashing that toy on the floor. Her prefered toys are squeaky.

            <h2>Mabel's Dislikes<h2>
            <p>
              While Mabel greets most humans with an open mind and a wagging tail, she's quite wary of veterinarians, dog groomers, and anyone else who touches her feet. She also does not like to dress up or wear anything larger than her collar. Mabel avoids loud stuff like raised voices, vegetable choppers, thunder, and fireworks. The 4th of July is her least favorite holiday. She also does not like to get her fur wet and struggles with baths, float trips, and mornings when the grass is a bit too dewy.

            <h2>Mabel Retention<h2>
            <p>
              When we adopted Mabel, it ocurred to me that someone out there must be missing her. I'm pretty sure she wasn't abandoned, because she is insanely precious. It's much more likely she escaped. She does have a tendency to wander off. She is microchipped and has my number in large print on her collar. That said, we have lost Mabel on two horrible occasions that have probably taken years off my life. One was when she heard a firework and hid under the porch all night. The other was when she found a hole in the fence. She was rescued and returned the next day by someone who saw her crossing a busy street. I don't remember his name, but I love him unconditionally.

            <h2>Life with Mabel<h2>
            <p>
              Despite her escape attempts, I think Mabel is happy with her forever home. I know Andrew and I are happy with her. Most dogs are easy to love. If we hadn't crossed paths with Mabel, I'd probably be making a website about a different dog. Still, I can't help but feel like we really lucked out. Did I mention she doesn't shed? And she was already housebroken. And her size makes her super portable. And don't get me started on the cuteness. And... she's immortal, so I don't have to get teared up talking about how I <i>hope</i> we have many, many more years together, because she'll just live forever. Mabel's the best.
